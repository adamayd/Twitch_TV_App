# Twitch TV API App

This is my take on the Free Code Camp project for the use of the Twitch TV API.

## Project Requirements

I decided that I would like to write this project in vanilla Javascript and CSS without the help of Bootstrap and JQuery.

### User Stories

* I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv
* I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
* If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
